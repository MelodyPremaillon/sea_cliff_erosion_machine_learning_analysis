# sea_cliff_erosion_machine_learning_analysis
Machine learning analysis performed on GlobR2C2 sea cliff erosion database [https://esurf.copernicus.org/articles/6/651/2018/esurf-6-651-2018.html].
Those codes where created during my PhD in GÃ©oscience Environnement Toulouse lab and were performed on R.

The goal was to understand why cliff erodes at global scale.
The first step was to create a database with data comming from litterature and public database. It describe cliff erosion rate [m/yr] and several parameters supposed to influence erosion (wave mean height, storm occurence, type of rock, meanannual rainfalls ...)

Then came the data analysis, oh yeah!

First I conduct an exploratory analysis, you can find the main results on my article.

Then, I applied a random forest analysis. It wasn't to predict an erosion rate but because random forest allows to see variable importance thanks to gini index. 
Here is the plot of decreasing Gini index (sorry it's in French!). My trees are trained to predict if the erosion rate will be less 10 cm/yr or speeder than this threshold.

So okay, it seems like rock resistance and the number of freezing days predict the best if sea cliffs are eroding slowly or not. But what appens if I change the threshold? If it's 15 cm/yr, will the important variables in my tree the same?

To verify, I made the threshold vary betwwen 10 cm/yr and 20 cm/yr, each time I recorded the rank in Gini ratio classification, and then plot it :

So this graph says that the two main parameters I spotted (number of freezing days and rock resistance) are always the two more important variables to predict wether the erosion rate will be slow or fast. The threshold values does not have an influence on the importance of this two variables.

The conclusion is, before building a house with a magnificent sea view on the top of a cliff, please verify the rock is not to soft and the climate is not too cold!
